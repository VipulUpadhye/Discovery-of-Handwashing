# Discovery-of-Handwashing
Analysis of the handwashing data published by Dr. Semmelweis.

The program analyzes the data of deaths of mothers recorded in Vienna General Hospital. It was seen that many women died after giving birth to a child in the hospital. The cause was later detected by Dr. Semmelweis who showed that the deaths were caused because the doctors did not wash their hands before performing the operation.
This program shows a visual representation of the proportion of deaths after handwashing was made obligatory as compared to those before handwashing was made obligatory.
